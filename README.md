   2) Open your IDE and clone the Uni-Virtual-Assistant code from Github or import from another location. 
   
   3) After the code has been imported you should see multiple .py files including commands.py, main.py, weather.py, and webbrowser.py. After everything has               imported successfully, you may now run the program.
   
   4) In order to run the program, there should be a green play button in your IDE that you should click.
   
   5) Uni will greet you and will ask you "how can I help you?"
   
   6) From here you may ask Uni to execute a command. The functionalities are as follows:
         - Tells the current time 
         - Tells the current date 
         - Opens YouTube 
         - Opens BlackBoard 
         - Searches wikipedia for someone and gives a short summary 
         - Searches google for a specific location

      These functionalities can also be seen on the main.py file. 
      
      7) When you are done asking for commands, you may exit out of the program by saying "thank you" or "thanks"
         
   *** Important ***
         - Uni looks for specific words to execute certain commands. For example, if you want Uni to search wikipedia for "LeBron James" you would have to say "who          is LeBron James?"
         
   Now that you have this program, you can use Uni to aid in your success! :)
